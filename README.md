## Picky-Wallpapers by Morteck! ##

After spending countless hours building my wallpaper collection only to lose them due to an rsync failure,
it was time to set up an official repository. These wallpapers were sourced from various sites 
such as Imagur, Pintreast, etc.

I will be updating the contents of this repository periodically, and will review all push requests. 

I'm overly selective with wallpapers, and figured if I am, surely there are others who are as well. 
I change my desktop wallpaper quite frequently, and having an asthetically pleasing work enviorment that
is not visually distracting is important for productivity. 

Please feel free to install and contribute! Please add only .png and .jpeg formats. 
See below for instructions on adding this repository to your machine. 

cd into the directory you use to house your cloned repo's and execute the following command:

$ git clone https://github.com/morteck/Picky-Icons.git

Feel free to send me a mssg if you encounter any bugs or issues.
