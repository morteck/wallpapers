After spending countless hours building my wallpaper collection only to lose them due to an rsync failure, it was time to set up an official repository. These wallpapers were sourced from various sites such as imgur, pinterest, and various other sites.

The contents of this repository will be updated periodically.

I'm overly selective with my wallpapers, and I do my best to select those that are distraction free and asthetically pleasing for my work enviorment.

Feel free to clone & contribute!
